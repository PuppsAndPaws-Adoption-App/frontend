####
# About
PEM, Inc. is a collaborative team of Verizon Apprentices with backgrounds in Web Development, Full Stack, and Cloud Engineering. The Verizon Operations and Logistics Team is looking for a full redesign of their warehouse inventory management system and has tasked PEM, Inc. to present a prototype of a redesigned Warehouse Management System that supports key essential elements while also reaching for stretch goals that are optional in completing the the task of "Building a Better Warehouse Management System".

Our team will demonstrate the skills we have learned thourghout the Verzion Thrive Apprenticeship/ Multiverse Bootcamp which include test-driven, object-oriented programming in JavaScript using a Node.js runtime environment; backend development building a SQLite database with a Sequelize Object Relational Mapper within an Express web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses; front-end development using handlebars and JavaScript DOM manipulation; and finally, development of a completed full-stack application following an Agile development process using Project Management Planning tools to manage and monitor project development using Jira Kanban Board, and Entity Relationship Diagram, and Sequential Relationship Diagram. A well, we used GitHub to support colaborative code development using commands:
<ul> <li>git add .</li> <li>git commit -m</li><li>git push</li><li>git checkout main</li><li>git pull</li><li>git checkout "branch"</li><li>git rebase main</li> </ul>
